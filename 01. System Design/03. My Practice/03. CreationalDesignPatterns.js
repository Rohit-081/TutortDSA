// Creational patterns consist of different mechanisms used to create objects.
// Creational design patterns in software development deal with the process of object creation. They provide solutions for creating objects in a way that is flexible, efficient, and suitable for different situations. Here are some common creational design patterns:

// Singleton Pattern:

// Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It's useful when you want to control access to a shared resource or configuration settings.
// Factory Method Pattern:

// Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created. It abstracts the object creation process, providing a way to decouple client code from the concrete classes it creates.
// Abstract Factory Pattern:

// Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. It's useful when you need to ensure that the created objects work together seamlessly.
// Builder Pattern:

// Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing you to create different variations of an object with a consistent construction process. It's particularly useful for creating complex objects step by step.
// Prototype Pattern:

// Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype. It's useful when the cost of creating an object from scratch is more expensive than copying an existing one.
// Object Pool Pattern:

// Manages a pool of pre-initialized objects, which can be reused to improve performance and reduce the overhead of creating new objects. It's beneficial in scenarios where creating and destroying objects is resource-intensive.
// Lazy Initialization Pattern:

// Defers the creation of an object until it's actually needed. This pattern can help optimize resource usage by creating objects on-demand rather than upfront.
// Dependency Injection Pattern:

// Provides objects with their dependencies (usually through constructor injection or property injection) instead of having them create their own dependencies. It promotes loose coupling and makes it easier to manage and test the components of a system.
// These creational design patterns are essential for managing object creation in a way that is consistent, efficient, and in accordance with the principles of software design and architecture. The choice of which pattern to use depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your project.
