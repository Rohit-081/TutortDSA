// Structural design patterns in software development focus on how objects and classes can be composed to form larger structures while keeping the system flexible and efficient. They address the relationships between objects, classes, and their composition. Here are some common structural design patterns:

// Adapter Pattern:

// Allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface. It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.
// Bridge Pattern:

// Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently. It is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
// Composite Pattern:

// Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It allows clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
// Decorator Pattern:

// Adds responsibilities to objects dynamically, without altering their structure. This pattern is useful for extending the functionality of classes without changing their code.
// Facade Pattern:

// Provides a simplified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It hides the complexity of the subsystem and offers a single entry point for the client to interact with it.
// Flyweight Pattern:

// Minimizes memory or computational overhead by sharing as much as possible with related objects. It is particularly useful when you need to create a large number of similar objects efficiently.
// Proxy Pattern:

// Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. It is often used to add a level of control over the interaction with the real object.
// Composite Pattern:

// Allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It is useful when you want to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
// Decorator Pattern:

// Allows you to add responsibilities to objects dynamically, without altering their structure. This pattern is useful for extending the functionality of classes without changing their code.
// Bridge Pattern:

// Separates an object's abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to evolve independently. It is useful when you want to avoid a permanent binding between an abstraction and its implementation.
// These structural design patterns help you create more flexible and maintainable software by focusing on how classes and objects interact and collaborate with one another. Choosing the right pattern depends on your system's requirements and the desired level of flexibility and abstraction.
